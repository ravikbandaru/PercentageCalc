Every iOS programmer has to debug their apps once in a while. Unless you’re some kind of crazy coding ninja, you know that desperate feeling when you have that desperate feeling when you have is to look for a bug in your code for hours and hours until you realize you made a simple syntax error. Or even worse, never finding the bugs. No matter if you are new to programming or have developed multiple apps, routinely writing unit tests will make your code more reliable, safer, and easier to debug!

Luckily for you, Xcode 7 and Swift support Unit Testing. Although Unit Testing doesn’t mean bug free apps, it’s still a very powerful way to verify that every piece or unit of code does its job and facilitate the process of debugging.
